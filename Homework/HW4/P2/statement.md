Given two arrays of integers A1 and A2, compute the sum of the product of every pair of entries in A1 and A2.<br>

Example: consider A1 = [1,2,3] and A2 = [4,5]<br>
The output is (1 x 4) + (1 x 5) + (2 x 4) + (2 x 5) + (3 x 4) + (3 x 5) = 54.

<ul>
<li>INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):<br>
  <ul>
    <li> The first line is a single integer n, the length of A1.
    <li> The next n lines are single integers, the content of A1.
    <li> The next line is a single integer m, the length of A2.
    <li> The next m lines are single integers, the content of A2.
  </ul>
<li>OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):<br>
Print a single integer, the sum of the product of every pair of entries in A1 and A2.
