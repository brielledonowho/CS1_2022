<ul>
<li> Start Jupyter Lab
<li> Start a terminal
<li> Go to CS1_2022
<li> run: git pull
<li> Run: bash initialize.sh
<li> Implement your solution in the existing Python files (make sure it passes the automated test!)
<li> When you are done with a problem, upload it on Canvas in the respective assignment.

Some things to note:<br>

<ul>
<li> You are starting off with empty Python files this time! You will choose how to structure the code that reads in the input (as per the problem specification), computes the solution, and prints <b>only</b> the solution.
<li> We have provided example inputs and ouputs in the problem statements to demonstrate the desired behavior. We have also provided small automated tests check.sh in each problem file that you can run via 'bash check.sh' in the terminal.
</ul>
