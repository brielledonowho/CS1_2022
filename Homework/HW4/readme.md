Some reminders and things to note:<br>

<ul>
<li>The functions aren't given to you. You must write functions that take in the proper arguments. For functions that take multiple arguments, add them in the order that they are mentioned in the problem.
<li>Example inputs and outputs are given. For the most part, they match the examples in the readme.md for the given problem. This should help you understand how to take them in as input.
<li>Your functions should all return things. DO NOT print inside your function. Call your function and print what is returned by it.
<li>You should write a function/functions to take input, as outlined in class. They should be able to take the input.txt files as input.
</ul>
