Given an array of integers A, cutoff value c, and quantity n, compute if there are at least n many values that are greater than or equal to c.<br>

Example: consider A = [5, 7, 10, 27, -2], c = 5, n = 3<br>
The output should be True, since there are 4 numbers greater than or equal to 5 in A.

<ul>
<li>INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):<br>
  <ul>
    <li> The first line is a single integer, the length of A.
    <li> The next n lines are single integers, the content of A.
    <li> The next line is a single integer c, the value of c.
    <li> The next line is a single integer n, the value of n.
  </ul>
<li>OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):<br>
Print the boolean value indicating if there at least n many values that are greater than or equal to c.
