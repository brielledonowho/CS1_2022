Given an integer n greater than or equal to 0, compute the sum of all the integers between 0 and n (inclusive) that are multiples of 4.<br>

Example for input 8: All the positive integers that count up to 8 are [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Of these numbers, 0, 4 and 8 are multiples of 4. You add these multiples: 0 + 8 + 4 = 12. In this case, the output should be 12. <br>

Example for input 15: All the numbers that count up to 15 are [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. Of these numbers, 0, 4 and 8 and 12 are multiples of 4. You add these multiples: 0 + 4 + 8 + 12 = 24. In this case, the output should be 24.

<ul>
<li>INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):<br>
A single line of input containing a single integer.
<li>OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):<br>
Print a single integer, the sum of all the integers between 0 and n (included) that are multiple of 4.
