#### Problem 1
 The following question is about words in the *Scrabble dictionary* word list.

Define a function which reads an integer from input, call this <code>n</code>. The function should do the following for the corresponding value of <code>n</code>: (Make sure to only **print one word per line.**)
1. Prints the length of the longest word.
2. Prints the first ten 15-letter words.
3. Prints all words with at least 5 occurrences of 'a'. Use the built in function <code>count</code>.
4. Prints all the words with the maximum possible number of occurrences of 'e'.
5. Find all the *palindromes*---these words that are the same backwards as forwards (ex. 'racecar'). Then, find the length of the longest palindrome and print all the palindromes of this length.
6. Print all words that contain the letter 'q' but do not contain the string 'qu'.
