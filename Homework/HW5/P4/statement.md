Given two sorted lists, merge them into one sorted list.

Example: consider A1 = [1, 3, 5] and A2 = [2, 4, 6].
The output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

• INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
  • The first line is a single integer n, the length of the first input list L1.
  • The next n lines are the contents of L1.
  • The next line is a single integer m, the length of the second input list L2.
  • The next m lines are the contents of L2.

• OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
  • Print the merged list.
