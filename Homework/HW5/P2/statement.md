Given a list of integers, make a new list of the cumulative sums of preceding numbers at each index.

Example: consider A = [2, 4, -1].
The output should be [2, 6, 5].

• INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
  • The first line is a single integer n, the length of the input list
  • The next n lines are the contents of the input list.
  
• OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
  • Print the cumulative list.
