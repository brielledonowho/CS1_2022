Given a sorted list of integers, compute the smallest difference between two numbers in that list.

Example: consider A = [2, 5, 6, 10].
The output should be 1.

• INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
  • The first line is a single integer n, the length of the input list.
  • The next n lines are the contents of the input list.

• OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
  • Print a single number, the smallest distance.
