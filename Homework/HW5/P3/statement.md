Given a list of integers, separate the odd and even numbers in it into two separate lists.

Example: consider A = [3, 2, 7, 4].
The output should be
[3, 7]
[2, 4]

• Input format (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
  • The first line is a single integer n, the length of the input list
  • The next n lines are the contents of the input list.

• Output format (print output to the terminal / stdout):
  • Print on the first the list of odd numbers.
  • Print on the second line the list of even numbers.
