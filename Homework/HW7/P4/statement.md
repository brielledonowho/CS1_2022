### Problem 4:
#### 2 Points

---

Implement a min stack. A min stack is a stack which has a minimum element that it keeps track of as elements are pushed and popped from the stack. Therefore, this implementation must have a way to keep track of the minimum element for both of these operations, and update it accordingly. This stack implementation should have an additional function, getMin(), which returns the minimum element held by the stack. After reading in an array from input like normal and pushing each element to the minstack, the program should call getMin() and print the result. 

###### Example:

- With <code>A = [4, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1]</code> and <code>x = 0</code>, your program should output 1 using a min stack. 

###### Input Format (input arrives from terminal / stdin):

- The first line will be an integer <code>n</code>, the length of array <code>A</code>.
- The next n lines will be integers making up array <code>A</code>.
###### Output Format (output to terminal / stdout):

- Print the smallest element of the array.
