### Problem 2:
#### 2 Points

---
A staircase has <code>n</code> steps; in each movement, you can climb either 1 or 2 steps of the staircase. Using the stack you implemented in Problem 1, write a program to determine how many distinct ways there are to climb such a staircase. 



###### Example:
-  When <code>n=3</code>, there are 3 distinct ways to climb the staircase: 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 2, and 2 + 1. 


###### Input Format (input arrives from terminal / stdin):

- A single line with the integer <code>n</code>.

###### Output Format (output to terminal / stdout):

- Print the number of distinct ways you can climb a staircase of length <code>n</code>.
