### Problem 2:
#### 2 Points

---
Use the stack you implemented in Problem 1 to determine whether strings containing the characters '{', '}', '(', ')', and '[', ']' are balanced (as discussed in class). Your program should print <code>True</code> if the input string is balanced and <code>False</code> otherwise. 


###### Hint:
-  You may want to iterate through the characters in the input string, checking whether each character is opening or closing and either pushing or popping from a working stack accordingly. 


###### Input Format (input arrives from terminal / stdin):

- A single line, containing a string <code>s</code>.

###### Output Format (output to terminal / stdout):

- Print <code>True</code> if <code>s</code> is balanced, <code>False</code> otherwise.
