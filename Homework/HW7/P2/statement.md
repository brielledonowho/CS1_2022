### Problem 2:
#### 2 Points

---
Use the stack you implemented in Problem 1 to determine how many different ways there are to climb a set of n stairs, starting from the bottom of the staircase. On each step, you can either climb one or two stairs. Your program should output how many unique paths you can take to reach the top. 


###### Hint:
-  You may want to first sketch out this problem on a piece of paper, determine an algorithm for the solution, and then see how a stack can help you implement that algorithm. 


###### Input Format (input arrives from terminal / stdin):

- A single line, containing the number of stairs <code>n</code>.

###### Output Format (output to terminal / stdout):

- Print <code>d</code>, the nuember of different ways you can climb this set of stairs.
