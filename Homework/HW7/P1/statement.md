### Problem 1:
#### 4 Points (Together with problem 2)

---
 The following question asks you to create and implement a stack, as discussed in class.

For the first part of this problem, your code should only implement a stack that takes a maximum size that can be passed to the initializer as a stack paramater.

More info on what a stack is below: 

In part 1 of this problem, you must create a stack that you can use in the later program as a structure to store and use data. From google, a stack is "an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed." Your stack should perform the following operations: push, pop, isEmpty(to see if the stack is empty), atMax(to see if you are at the stack capacity), current(returns what position you are at in the stack), and peek(to return the value at the stack pointer currently but not change any aspect of the stack i.e. pop). Lastly, you will need a constructor function to initialize the stack. You can read more about what a stack is an how to implement it here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/stack_algorithm.htm.

You will then be asked to use this stack implementation to solve a problem in part 2. 
 
**Note:** There will not be a corresponding text file to read in, but you may write a simple one in order to test your stack and see if it is working yourself. 

**Note:** Due to the nature of the problem, no test cases are provided.
