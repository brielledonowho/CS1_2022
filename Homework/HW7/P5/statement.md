### Problem 5:
#### 2 Points

---

Using any of the stack implementations above and given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results. For example, if given the string "axxyzzyxxaccc", you should use a stack to return "axyzc". This program should read in a string from the input text file, and return the string with no duplicates. 

###### Example:

- With <code>str = "abcdefcde", your program should print "abcdef". 

###### Input Format (input arrives from terminal / stdin):

- The first line will be an string that is not enclosed by quotations
  .
###### Output Format (output to terminal / stdout):

- Print the lexicographically smallest string of no duplicates.
