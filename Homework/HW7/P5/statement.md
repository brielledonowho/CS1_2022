### Problem 5:
#### 2 Points

---

Using one of the stack types implemented in Problems 1, 3, and 4, write a problem that takes a string <code>s</code> and returns the subsequence <code>s'</code> of <code>s</code> such that:
1. <code>s'</code> consists of <code>s</code> with duplicate letters removed, i.e., <code>s'</code> contains all the letters in <code>s</code> (in order) and does not contain any duplicate letters, and 
2. <code>s'</code> is the smallest subsequence of <code>s</code> with property (1.), as measured by lexigoraphical order.

###### Example:

- With input str = "bcabc", your program should print "abc", as it is lexicographically smaller than "cab" and "bca" (i.e., it would appear earlier in a dictionary). 

###### Input Format (input arrives from terminal / stdin):

- A single line containing a string <code>s</code>.
  
###### Output Format (output to terminal / stdout):

- Print the string <code>s'</code>, as described above.
